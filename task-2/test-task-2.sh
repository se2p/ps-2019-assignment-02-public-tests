# Test the java implementation which works by getting automatically generating input and outputs.
# Tests are composed of assertions (on the output) and secret code. Digits is always 4
# To check the assertions an input file will be derived from the output that your program produces and an expected.output file must be produced by an oracle that implement correctly the system. Most likely this the code you implemented for your previous assignment, or an updated version of that.
